# DUNGEONEERING

A Java project which generates a mystery dungeon for an md rp.

Contains:
 - XPGuide: outlines various Pokemon and their experience rates. (Name, Experience Rate)
 - RPers: lists roleplay characters and current stats. (Name, Level, Experience, Leveling Speed)
 - dg_MASTERFORMAT: defines the format used to describe a dungeon in a file. When creating a dungeon, replace <THIS> with appropriate stats.
 
Updates that really need to be made:
 - Fix the random NullPointerException in DungeonGenerator when adding items to the spoils array
 - Let DungeonGeneratorDriver take in system input
 - Code the leveling formulas for the erratic and fluctuating leveling rates
 - Improve the XP printout to display more information
 - Add MOAR DUNGEONS, MOAR POKEMON
